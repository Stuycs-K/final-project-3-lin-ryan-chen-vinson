## Overview
Our project is a recreation of classical chess using Processing. The game will be played between two human players. Players will not be able to play against an AI bot. The board has the size of a normal chess board (8x8 squares), and the game will start with all normal pieces in their expected positions. The normal movements of these pieces will follow the expected rules. For instance, the Knight will be the only piece that can jump over other pieces to get to a new position, and moves in an L shape. Special movements/features are also included, which only occur when their respective requirements are fulfilled, such as pawn promotion, castling, and en passant.

A turn system is also implemented, with White receiving the first turn in every match. Players will be able to select and move pieces to a new square by clicking on the respective squares. They can view the allowed movements through highlighted squares that appear when a piece is clicked. A message bar on the bottom of the screen can be used to view the player who has the current turn, as well as when a player is in check. Lastly, a win screen will appear when one of the players is checkmated.
